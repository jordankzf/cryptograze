# Cryptograze

Cryptograze is a web application that allows users to track the top 100 cryptocurrencies. It supports multiple fiat currencies and allows users to view multiple cryptocurrencies in detail simultaneously. The data may be refreshed on-demand with just one mouse click.

## How to run

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

Alternatively, you can visit the live deployed version of the app at [http://cryptograze.vercel.app](http://cryptograze.vercel.app).

## Technologies used

Cryptograze was built with the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-rendered applications. I chose Next.js for its serverless functions and ease of deployment to Vercel.
- **bignumber.js**: A JavaScript library for arbitrary-precision decimal arithmetic. I used this library to ensure accuracy when dealing with financial data.
- **MobX**: A state management library for React. I chose MobX because I believe it is the state management solution used by RabbitX.
